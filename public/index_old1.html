                <p>Rotaract Club of NITK is one of the five exclusive clubs of the institute as well as the sole socio-cultural club. Having its accreditation from Rotary International, established in 1962, Rotaract Clubs (or “Rotary in Action” as they call it) reach international standards. The term “Rotaract” is the culmination of the words “Rotary” and “Interact”. Rotary International is an international, secular organization formed for the purpose of bringing together business and professional leaders in order to provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. Rotaract Clubs worldwide are sponsored and supported by Rotary International. Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in 1968 at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, and has grown into a major Rotary-sponsored organization of over 9,539 clubs spread around the world and 219,397 members. It is a service, leadership and community service organization for young men and women between the ages 18–30.</p>

                <p>The club conducts various events over multi-faceted disciplines - Social, Cultural, Technical and Literature - and has therefore established itself as the only club to be conducting events across all domains for students and club members alike. Some of the events conducted last year were Headstart, Game of Thrones, JAM, Bluff master, Blockbuster, Rubik’s cube workshop, sign language workshop, Raazmataz, Fragfest, etc.</p>

                <p>Every year Rotaract Club of NITK, with the other four exclusive clubs of the institute i.e. IEEE, CSI, IE and ISTE conduct a Campus Clean Up Drive. The amount of waste collected last year was around one ton.</p>

                <p>Keeping Rotary International’s motto of “Service Above Self” in mind, Rotaract Club, NITK Chapter aims at the development of young adults as leaders in their communities and workplaces. For the purpose the club has brought up SIG’s or Special Interest Groups like Tronics SIG and Comps SIG for those inclined towards the technical field, Literary and Arts SIG for the readers, Finance SIG, etc. with their own weekly schedules. Similarly Rotalks is a platform for the speakers, the philosophers and the debaters to let their heart out.</p>

                <p>A cloth collection drive followed by an orphanage trip every year is merely an attempt by the club to ensure some facilities to those kids.</p>

                <p>Moreover, the Annual Charity Play every year conducted by the club not only collects a good amount of charity but also showcases the talent of the students. Last year’s play, an adaptation of “One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest” collected a whopping sum of 63,000 rupees which was donated by Rotary, Surathkal for building a school for blind and dumb children.</p>

                <p>The club also takes part in international service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and international understanding to the world. Needless to say, Rotaract Club is one of the very few clubs known and recognized globally. “Whispering Winds” is a monthly newsletter initiated by Rotaract Clubs of Kathmandu, Karachi, Bhutan and NITK together to present to each other our cultures, exchange views and opinions.</p>

                <p>Rotutor is an initiative by Rotaract Club, NITK Chapter, a weekly program to provide Basic English knowledge to school kids at the NITK English Medium School. Whereas, Avanti is a mentoring program for students belonging to the lower middle class section of the society preparing for competitive engineering entrance exams. Besides the student mentors get an internship to add to their resume.</p>

                <p>Putting in efforts for the purpose of the club, members of Rotaract Club, NITK till date have been able to present a myriad of events and activities, all mesmerizing and all focusing on the development of fellow students and the community.</p>

                                <p>The NITK Chapter of Avanti Fellows has well moved onto achieving great results since its inception in the institute in 2013. It involves students from NITK across all branches and years, who volunteer to mentor 11th and 12th standard JEE aspirant students of JNV Mudipu. Every Sunday, mentors from NITK engage students of both the classes for roughly a three hour session, which includes basic doubt solving and concept revision; peer learning; and most importantly, psychological motivation of the students by the mentors.

                                <br>Avanti has had major success regarding admissions into IITs and NITs. With respect to NITK, Chetan Gudisagar, an alumnus from JNV Pondicherry, secured the IT branch in NITK in 2013. In 2015, two students from JNV Mudipu, Preethan and Rathan joined NITK in the Civil Engineering and Computer Science branches respectively.

                                <br>Avanti is a socially conscious enterprise touching and transforming the lives of thousands of students nation wide. Rotaract - NITK Chapter is proud to support the cause of quality education for all. </p>

				<br>They've done projects in Italy, Panama and India in cities like Mumbai and Chennai. They conduct workshops that involves the awareness of the space/place through a clear lecture of the built environment, i.e. the value of the context and their primal typologies (Market, Church and Dwellings). These themes are approached through drawings, models and conversations.Operai's users belong to cities that have radically assimilated modernity, this is why OOperai's aim is to question their learned habits. We at Rotaract support this initiative through our orphanage trips. One of members at Rotaract NITK, Hari Krishnan was one of the project coordinator Of Ooperai in India. We planning on working on more projects this year in collaboration with the Ooperai team.</p>

                                <p>Beach clean up drive is conducted to bring awareness among us students about how important it is to protect the pride of our college. Having a private beach for the college is great but maintaining it clean and not spoiling its natural environment is the responsibility that comes along with it. Beach clean up drive is generally conducted in the odd semester on a n early morning of a weekend where the students volunteer and join with the members of Rotoract Club NITK Charter and clean up the man made trash along the coast of Arabian Ocean that comes under NITK beach. This makes one think twice before throwing trash in the beach again and also its a very satisfying job as once all the trash is cleared up, the beach becomes beautiful again and makes one feel like a part responsible for it being that way. In 2012 the Panambur coast guard inaugurated the Beach clean-up drive.</p>
                                <p>All the equipment necessary for cleaning like garbage bags, gloves and caps are provided for the volunteers and after the task is completed, all of them are provided with refreshments and also certificates are given away for volunteering for a good cause.</p>

                                <p>Rotaract Club NITK chapter visits an orphanage every year. It is open for all Rotaract members as well as Non Rotaract members. A cloth collection drive is organised in NITK hostels so that old and unused clothes can be donated to inmates of the orphanage. We provide lunch to them and give them old clothes. We also give them stationery items and chocolates. The children are very happy to see these gifts. On the last orphanage trip we took all the children to zoo. They were divided into 6 groups, and each group was assisted by 3 people from NITK. They enjoyed a lot. For many of them it was their first time when they had visited a zoo, so they were amazed to see a tiger and a lion. Snacks was provided after the zoo visit and various games were played. Thus orphanage trips are one of the most successful ventures executed by the Rotaract club.</p>

                                <p>The Book Club is one of the Special Interest groups (SIG) of Rotaract NITK which was started in the academic year 2013-2014. It is part of the literary initiative undertaken by the club. Here members of the club who are passionate about reading books get together and choose a book to read for a period of one month. The meetings happen once every two weeks.These meetings give the members a platform to express their views regarding the book- the plot, the characters, language etc. The discussions range from how the fictional stories are about life passages, with everyone having a different journey, to how each person involved in the discussion relates and interprets it in a different manner. The books that were discussed include classics like The Godfather, The Great Gatsby, Malgudi Days, To kill a Mockingbird, Catcher in the Rye etc. Basically the club gives us a brilliant opportunity to follow our passion of reading and interact with others who share the same love for books.</p>

                                <p>The “Finance” Special Interest Group (SIG) of Rotaract Club was constituted during the academic year 2013-14 to discuss current affairs in the finance sector, pursue independent courses in finance  and discuss future prospects for the members interested in the field through the guidance of seniors  already studying the subject. The Finance SIG held meeting once every week where some of the following activities were held.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Meetings start with the discussion of most significant events in the finance sector that happened throughout the week. (One of the most discussed topic was the appointment of the new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and the policy changes proposed to break the stupor of the Indian Economy.)</li>
                                        <li>Members experienced in the field held Knowledge Exchange Programs (KEPs) to guide other interested members about the various future prospects and the path to be pursued to achieve a particular goal in the field.</li>
                                        <li>Introductory finance courses offered by the National Stock Exchange such as Introduction to Financial Markets, Securities and Derivatives Markets were taken up. Each week one chapter of these would be done as assignment and a corresponding discussion be held during the meetings, to clear doubts and share additional information. This has helped create a basic financial knowhow and has given a direction to the interested members.</li>
